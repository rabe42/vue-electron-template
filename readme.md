# The Vue Electron Template

## Remark
**This is not completed or anyhow ready for start.**

## Objective
The objective of this template is to create a simple to use and easy to learn template for creating electron applications based on the Vue tookit. It facilates w3css and awesomefont to create a simple responsible clean look and feel.

## Usage
The following targets are defined, which helps you to build your application and operate in the development process:

- **clean** - Deletes dest/ and node_modules/ folder.
- **start** - Starts the electron application. Requires a compile:view before
- **compile:view** - Compile the sources once into the dest directory.
- **compile:view:watch** - Compile the sources into the dest directory and watches the source files for recompilation.

## Approach
As there are a lot of templates for electron and Vue available in the open. I tried some of them. Unfortunately a lot of this is outdates or so complicated that I felt uncertain, if this is really what I want.

Therefore I started with a minimal setting for myself. I try to leave this as easy as possible. Easy to understand also for non professionals.

## Intended Audience

Other software engineers, like me, which moved to management, but need to keep track on new technologies.
